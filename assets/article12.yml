description: "This project was a redesign of the SAA's website, completed while I was at Tentwelve agency. I led the design creation, ensuring the new design stayed true to SAA’s DNA while modernizing the overall look and feel. I also contributed to the front-end development. The goal was to create a clean, user-friendly experience that respected the organization’s identity while giving it a fresh, contemporary visual language."
