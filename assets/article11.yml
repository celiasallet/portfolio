description: "This project was a redesign of the Fête de la Musique Belgium website, completed while I was at Tentwelve agency. I led the design creation and collaborated with Greygouar's famous illustrations, while also contributing to the front-end development. The concept was inspired by the vibrant energy of the music festival, which I translated into bold colors and playful visual elements. The goal was to create a cohesive visual identity that would engage visitors online and offline, organize a large database in a clear form, and capture the spirit of the event in a fun and striking way."
