description: "This project involved creating a print poster to promote an event at Mont des Arts. The design was inspired by a unique experience I had with a sauce-covered lid I encountered one day... Well well well ... You can actually see that I used another wet lid as inspiration for my latest Nouvoilà theme party. This unexpected moment sparked my creativity, leading me to incorporate vibrant colors and textures reminiscent of that image into the poster, aiming to capture attention and evoke curiosity about the event."
